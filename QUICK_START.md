# 🚀 Cost-Optimized GCP Deployment - Quick Start Guide

## What's Been Added

Your codebase now includes a **cost-optimized GCP Compute Engine instance** with comprehensive deployment automation:

### 📊 Cost Optimization Features
- ✅ **Preemptible Instance**: Up to 80% cost savings
- ✅ **e2-micro Machine Type**: Smallest available, Always Free tier eligible
- ✅ **10GB Standard Disk**: Minimum cost storage
- ✅ **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS**: Free operating system
- ✅ **No External IP**: Eliminates external IP charges
- ✅ **Estimated Monthly Cost**: ~$3.92/month

### 🛠️ New Files Added
- `main.tf` - Updated with compute instance configuration
- `variables.tf` - Added compute instance variables
- `policy/computepolicy.rego` - OPA policy for cost optimization compliance
- `.github/workflows/terraform.yml` - Updated GitHub Actions workflow
- `deploy.ps1` - PowerShell deployment script
- `deploy.sh` - Bash deployment script
- `monitor-costs.ps1` - Cost monitoring script
- `setup-github-deployment.ps1` - GitHub setup automation
- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive deployment guide
- `GITHUB_SECRETS_SETUP.md` - GitHub secrets setup instructions

## 🎯 Next Steps for GitHub Actions Deployment

### Step 1: Setup GitHub Secrets
Run the setup script to prepare your environment:

```powershell
# Run the automated setup script
.\setup-github-deployment.ps1 -ProjectId "your-gcp-project-id" -CreateServiceAccount

# Or follow the manual guide
# See: GITHUB_SECRETS_SETUP.md
```

**Required GitHub Secrets:**
- `GCP_SA_KEY` - Service account JSON key
- `GCP_PROJECT_ID` - Your GCP project ID  
- `GCP_BUCKET_NAME` - Base name for storage bucket (optional)

### Step 2: Verify GitHub Actions Workflow
Your repository now has an automated workflow that:

1. **Validates** Terraform configuration
2. **Runs OPA policies** for compliance checking
3. **Calculates cost estimates** for deployment
4. **Comments on PRs** with compliance results
5. **Deploys infrastructure** on main branch (if compliant)
6. **Validates deployment** post-deployment

### Step 3: Deploy Infrastructure

#### Option A: Push to Main Branch (Automatic)
```powershell
# Your changes are already committed and pushed
# The workflow will automatically run on the main branch
```

#### Option B: Manual Deployment Trigger
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Actions tab → "GCP Cost-Optimized Infrastructure Deployment"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select action: `apply` or `destroy`

#### Option C: Create Pull Request
```powershell
# Create a feature branch for testing
git checkout -b feature/test-deployment
git push origin feature/test-deployment

# Create PR to see compliance check results
```

## 💰 Cost Monitoring

### Monitor Your Deployment
```powershell
# Check current costs and resources
.\monitor-costs.ps1

# Show detailed information
.\monitor-costs.ps1 -ShowDetailed

# Specify project explicitly
.\monitor-costs.ps1 -ProjectId "your-project-id"
```

### Key Cost Management Commands
```bash
# List all instances
gcloud compute instances list

# Stop instance (saves money)
gcloud compute instances stop cost-optimized-vm-prod

# Start instance when needed
gcloud compute instances start cost-optimized-vm-prod

# Delete instance (stops all charges)
gcloud compute instances delete cost-optimized-vm-prod
```

## 🔍 Deployment Status

Check your GitHub Actions workflow status:
1. Go to repository → Actions tab
2. Look for "GCP Cost-Optimized Infrastructure Deployment"
3. Check run status and logs

### Workflow Features
- ✅ **Terraform validation** and formatting
- ✅ **OPA policy compliance** checking
- ✅ **Cost estimation** and reporting
- ✅ **PR comments** with detailed results
- ✅ **Automated deployment** on main branch
- ✅ **Post-deployment validation**
- ✅ **Cost monitoring recommendations**

## 🛡️ Compliance Policies

Your deployment includes comprehensive OPA policies:

### Storage Policy (`storagepolicy.rego`)
- Enforces uniform bucket level access
- Validates security configurations

### Compute Policy (`computepolicy.rego`)
- Ensures preemptible instances (cost savings)
- Validates cost-effective machine types
- Checks disk size limits
- Enforces proper labeling for cost tracking

## 📊 Expected Results

After successful deployment, you'll have:
- ✅ **Preemptible e2-micro instance** running Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- ✅ **Cloud Storage bucket** with compliance policies
- ✅ **Cost-optimized configuration** saving up to 80% on compute costs
- ✅ **Comprehensive monitoring** and alerting setup
- ✅ **Automated policy validation** preventing costly misconfigurations

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **GitHub Secrets Not Set**
   - Run `.\setup-github-deployment.ps1` 
   - Follow `GITHUB_SECRETS_SETUP.md`

2. **Policy Violations**
   - Check workflow logs for specific violations
   - Review OPA policy files in `policy/` directory

3. **Authentication Errors**
   - Verify service account has correct permissions
   - Check if APIs are enabled (Compute, Storage, IAM)

4. **Billing Issues**
   - Ensure billing is enabled on GCP project
   - Verify payment method is valid

### Debug Commands
```powershell
# Test local deployment
.\deploy.ps1

# Check Terraform configuration
terraform init
terraform validate
terraform plan

# Test OPA policies locally
terraform plan -out=tfplan
terraform show -json tfplan > tfplan.json
opa eval -d policy/ -i tfplan.json "data.terraform.compute.policy_summary"
```
